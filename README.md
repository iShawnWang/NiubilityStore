# NiubilityStore
Yet another dead simple unpredictable state container



Since [Redux](https://redux.js.org) is really annoying to use, I want to keep code as simple as possible.

The `store` should be easy like a global js variable `var state = {}` !!!

Here is the `NiubilityStore`



## Usage



```
var Store = require("niubilitystore")

Store["blahblah"] = "Lorem ipsum"
```
